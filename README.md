# Shell in C
I tried to recode shell in C from scratch. The project is at a very primitive state for now. But i how it will grow in the future !

## Idea
Everything in the initial commit has been made through the guidance of the Code Crafters ["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).
CodeCrafters is a website which guides you through the creation of advanced programming projects, providing you with a roadmap and tests to ensure everything works correctly.
I encourage you to try if you want to practice programming (not sponsored).
